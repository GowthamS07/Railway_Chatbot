policies:
  # KerasPolicy here uses LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) a RNN architecture to choose the next action
  - name: KerasPolicy
    epochs: 100
    max_history: 5

  # FallbackPolicy as the name suggests fallsback from the conversation if the intent doesn't meet the threshold value of 50%
  - name: FallbackPolicy
    fallback_action_name: 'action_default_fallback'

  # MemoizationPolicy memorises the conversation that we have given in the training data.
  # max_history is important as it tells us how much dialogue history the model looks at to decide the next action.
  - name: MemoizationPolicy
    max_history: 5

# To train the model use the command given in ReadMe file.
